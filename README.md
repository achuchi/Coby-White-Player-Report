As stated in the repository description, the goal of this project is to look at the 2024 season performance of NBA player Coby White. White took an increased role with the Bulls this season due the injuries of both Zach LaVine and Lonzo Ball. This project hopes to chronicle the increase in the production he saw this last season as well as figure out whether the higher production yielded better team results.

Current Implementations:
- PPG and APG trends based on NBAStatR library data
- Field shooting % data over last three seasons based on NBAStatR library data

Future Goals:
- On/Off data mapping and applying that data to team performance (method is TBD)
- Trend tracking (in bar chart form etc) of per 36 and per 100 possession metrics from BBall reference data
